        I'm nowadays mostly a programmer, but have been involved in many great non-programming projects during recent years. These projects, to name a few, include producing podcasts for clients, hosting a weekly radio show about startups and leading the Finnish high school students union. In the future, I'd like to continue doing projects with real impact.
