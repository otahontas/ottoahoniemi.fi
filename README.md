## Homesite created based on Gatsbys hello-world boilerplate

Built with help from
- Official Gatsby tutorial: <https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/>
- Mvp.css: <https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/>

Working:
- Homesite + resume in English
- Stylings based on semantic HTML
- Prittier, eslint etc. configs
- Deployment, currently with basic rsync to server, where site is running behind traefik reverse proxy + nginx container (see docker-compose for more info)

Todo:
- Get resume data from json file / even directely from LinkedIn. 
- Add i18n localisation for Finnish
- Make resume look better, more visuals
